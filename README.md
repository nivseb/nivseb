### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate full stack software developer with a strong focus on crafting robust and efficient solutions. Also enjoy
the operational aspects of deploying and managing applications with docker and kubernetes.

### About Me

My primary expertise lies in **PHP** leveraging the **Laravel** framework. For frontend development, **Vue.js** is my
go-to choice for creating engaging and interactive user interfaces.

My approach to development emphasizes **reusability**. In the most cases I will build that based on restful apis, but also open for other solutions.
